# The Surface RT, Where Did It Go Wrong?

You _may_ have heard of the Surface RT.
A super lightweight laptop-tablet hybrid.
It seemed to be great. Only issue were the multiple issues.

There were many critically acclaiming issues on this device ranging from
 
 - There being no apps other than ones that run off the (now shutdown) Windows Store. 
 - Arm32, so even if you downloaded apps, they would never run.
 - 2gb of ram, which at its MSRP of $599. 599 for something that can barely run its own OS.
 - The small trackpad, which causes cramps.

Even then, that's not even a full list, but the noteable ones.
